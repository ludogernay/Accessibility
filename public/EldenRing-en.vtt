00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Pure and radiant, he wields love to shrive clean the hearts of men.

2
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
There is nothing more terrifying.

3
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
In that forsaken place, blood must spill.

4.
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
The blood of your fellows,

5.
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
the Erdtree faithful.

6.
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000
They were never saints.

7.
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
They just happened to be on the losing side of a war.

8.
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Mother, wouldst thou truly Lordship sanction,

9.
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
in one so bereft of light?

10.
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
I presume you, too, are keen to know.

11.
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Just what Kind Miquella is doing here.

12.
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Those stripped of the Grace of Gold shall all meet death.

13.
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
In the embrace of Messmer's flame.

14.
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Come, now. Touch the withered arm, and travel to the realm of shadow.

15.
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
I will not be far behind. May we meet again.
